_There is a more comprehensive repository including all psychophysical data and code employed for the data analysis [here](https://github.com/wichmann-lab/robustness-development)_

Hi there, in this repo you will find the code employed for the psychophysical experiment in the ["Out-of-distribution robustness: Limited image exposure of a four-year-old is enough to outperform ResNet-50"](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=7yMg2rS9N5I) paper accepted at the 3rd Workshop on Shared Visual Representations in Human and Machine Intelligence (SVRHM2021) of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference.

Please note that the out-of-distribution dataset we created using salt-and-pepper noise is not publicity available due to copy right issues. The same is true for other images used for the gui of the experiment. However, feel free to contact me and I will be happy to share the images with you privately. 

Further note, that we also performed other experiments (eidolon & cue-conflict), which are not discribed in the paper mentioned above. However, each participants only took part in one of these experiments.
